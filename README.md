This is the GitHub repo for Erdos Institute May 2024 Data Science Boot Camp project #41. Our project predicts [MRLC land coverage](https://www.mrlc.gov/data) in New York State from [GEDI canopy height and structure](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LARSE_GEDI_GEDI02_A_002) data. Our executive summary include more details on our work.

The data folder contains csv files which aggregate GEDI and MRLC data across the state of New York. The modules folder contains Python scripts we used to obtain this data. Other folders contain various notebooks for data cleaning and analysis.
