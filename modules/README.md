# Data Download
The GEDI mission has produced *a lot* of data, most of which is not relevant to any given research question. This folder contains a tool which takes a list of GEDI granule urls, and downloads a user-specified list of desired features from each shot in each granule which passes an arbitrary user-specified requirement. This allows users to download only data useful to their research, which often requires orders of magnitude less space than the full granules. The ```get_nys_data.py``` script demonstrates this tool by downloading several features of interest from all of the L2A granules overlapping New York State. The resulting ```.csv``` files for each granule are in the ```data/``` folder. Note that many are empty! These granules contain no shots which passed the subsetting filters used in the demo.

Note that even though the tool reduces the size of the download considerably, it still runs slowly, because it must scrape hundreds of megabytes of data in each granule, even if most of this data is ultimately discarded. Therefore, our code is perfectly parallelizable, to speed up execution as much as possible. Even with significant parallelization, however, it is important to download from as few granules as possible. We recommend using the [Earth Data CMR API](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/site/docs/search/api.html#c-spatial) determine which granules overlap your region of interest before downloading.
